# MypythonExamples
Various examples while reading Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart.

These are examples that I created while going through Automate the Boring Stuff.  This is a great book that teaches the basic of python, but allows you to expand on the examples.  Basically a great way to start out.  I have been able to program my first python project for my work, small but effective.
